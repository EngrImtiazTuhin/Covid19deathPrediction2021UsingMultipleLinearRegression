# Covid19deathPrediction2021UsingMultipleLinearRegression
#Problem: Predict death no. using the sample data of the excel file which is the covid 19 affected people's data in Bangladesh of 2021
#ignore .idea and venv files which are the helper files to run the project in the python IDE.

#Independent/input variables are new_cases, new_tests which I set as X, Depenedent/ Target variable is new_deaths which is considered as Y

#See the DataVisualization.py file at first. Here, check the excel file's sample data. See SampleDatacsvFile.pdf file (10 data is seen here out of total 231 rows).
Then, You can see the graph's representation of the new_cases vs new_deaths and new_tests vs new_deaths in the new_caseVSnew_Deaths, new_TestsVSnew_Deaths image files

#Next, check the main.py file it is the main file where you can predict the model by giving input and also will be able to check the coefficients and validate these.

#Finally, you should see the accuracy of the model in the ModelAccuracy.py file (optional).
